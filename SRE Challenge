Hey Corey - Here is my reply for the task.

I do not have experience on Ansible,Chef or Puppet which is why I did not work on this first Challenge. 

And below is my response for the deliverables:

1) Installed Apache webserver on amazon aws EC2 instance
EC2 access details have been provided in the file attached to this email. You can verify the EC2 instance configuration details.
2) Configured web page rendering "SRE CHALLENGE" at below URL
http://174.129.67.209
3) Configured http redirect to https
http://174.129.67.209/ will redirect to https://174.129.67.209/

We will see https warning message while accessing https  URL. I have not used a domain as it incurrs some cost. 
4) Configured host-based firewall for ports 22,80 and 443 on EC2 instance
Please see the below screenshot of this configuration(firewall_config)
5) Test to verify the webserver is listening on 443
Please see the screenshot attached screenshot for this configuration(Health_check1,Health_check2).

Like I mentioned above, I've provided read only access to see my setup/configurations on Amazon EC2. Please go through it and let me know if you need further details.
